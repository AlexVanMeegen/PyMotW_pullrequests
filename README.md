# PyMotW Pull Requests

This is a dummy repository provided as a sandbox to play around with pull requests during the [PyMotW](https://github.com/INM-6/Python-Module-of-the-Week/tree/master/session23_PullRequests).

To make it a bit fun, we make this a collection of useful IT / programming / ... tricks. To avoid too many merge conflicts, we create a markdown file for each trick (see `mounting_cluster_filesystem.md`).

Here's a sweet online game to learn and practie git-ting: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

## Manifest

  - _file:///home/alex/Documents/PyMotW_pullrequests/mounting_cluster_filesystem.md_ : A handy alias to mount blaustein/JURECA to $HOME/remote.
  - _install_python_packages.sh_ : Script to setup Python for numerical work: create a `compute` virtual environment and install Jupyter, Spyder, numpy, etc.
  - _terminal_insults.md_ : A nice Easter Egg in Linux
