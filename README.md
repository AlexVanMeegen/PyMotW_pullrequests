# PyMotW Pull Requests

This is a dummy repository provided as a sandbox to play around with pull requests during the [PyMotW](https://github.com/INM-6/Python-Module-of-the-Week/tree/master/session23_PullRequests).

To make it a bit fun, we make this a collection of useful IT / programming / ... tricks. To avoid too many merge conflicts, we create a markdown file for each trick (see `mounting_cluster_filesystem.md`).
